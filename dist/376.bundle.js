The direction of the vector is from its tail\n          to its head.\n        </p>\n        <img\n          src="https://mathinsight.org/media/image/image/vector.png"\n          alt="vector"\n          width="449"\n          height="221"\n          class="mx-auto"\n        />\n        <p class="">\n          Two vectors are the same if they have the same magnitude and\n          direction. This means that if we take a vector and translate it to a\n          new position (without rotating it), then the vector we obtain at the\n          end of this process is the same vector we had in the beginning.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Two examples of vectors are those that represent force and velocity.\n          Both force and velocity are in a particular direction.

Here we define\n        <strong>addition</strong>, <strong>subtraction</strong>, and\n        <strong>multiplication</strong> by a scalar. On separate pages, we\n        discuss two different ways to multiply two vectors together:\n        <u><a href="/learn/vectors/dot-product" data-link class="text-[#2bbc8a] font-semibold">the dot product</a></u>.\n      </p>\n\n      <h1 class="text-2xl font-semibold pt-4">Addition of Vectors</h1>\n      <p>\n        Given two vectors \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\) , we form their sum\n        \\(\\vec{a}\\)+\\(\\vec{b}\\) , as follows. We translate the vector\n        \\(\\vec{b}\\) until its tail coincides with the head of \\(\\vec{a}\\)\n        . (Recall such translation does not change a vector.) Then, the directed\n        line segment from the tail of \\(\\vec{a}\\) to the head of\n        \\(\\vec{b}\\) is the vector \\(\\vec{a}\\)+\\(\\vec{b}\\) .\n      </p>\n      <img\n        src="https://mathinsight.org/media/image/image/vector_a_plus_b.png"\n        width="530"\n        height="152"\n        class="mx-auto"\n      />\n\n      <p>\n        The vector addition is the way forces and velocities combine.

The velocity vectors form a right triangle,\n        where the total velocity is the hypotenuse. Therefore, the total speed\n        of the object (i.e., the magnitude of the velocity vector) is \\(\n        \\sqrt{20^2 + 20^2} \\) = 20 \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) kilometers per hour\n        relative to the ground.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>Addition of vectors satisfies two important properties.</p>\n\n      <div class="pl-10">\n        1.
