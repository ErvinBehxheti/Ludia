Let\'s imagine we have two vectors \\(\\vec{a}\\) and\n        \\(\\vec{b}\\) , and we want to calculate how much of \\(\\vec{a}\\) is\n        pointing in the same direction as the vector \\(\\vec{b}\\) . We want a\n        quantity that would be positive if the two vectors are pointing in\n        similar directions, zero if they are perpendicular (when their tails\n        touch and they form a 90 degree angle), and negative if the two vectors\n        are pointing in nearly opposite directions. We will define the dot\n        product between the vectors to capture these quantities.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        But first, notice that the question ‚Äúhow much of \\(\\vec{a}\\) is\n        pointing in the same direction as the vector \\(\\vec{b}\\) ‚Äù does not\n        have anything to do with the magnitude (or length) of \\(\\vec{b}\\) ;\n        it is based only on its direction. (Recall that a vector has a magnitude\n        and a direction.) The answer to this question should not depend on the\n        magnitude of \\(\\vec{b}\\) , only its direction. To sidestep any\n        confusion caused by the magnitude of \\(\\vec{b}\\) , let\'s scale the\n        vector so that it has length one. In other words, let\'s replace\n        \\(\\vec{b}\\) with the\n        <abbr title="A unit vector is a vector with the length of 1"\n          >unit vector</abbr\n        >\n        that points in the same direction as \\(\\vec{b}\\) . We\'ll call this\n        vector \\(\\vec{u}\\) , which is defined by\n      </p>\n      <p class="text-center">\n        \\[ \\vec{u} = \\frac{\\vec{b}}{\\lvert \\vec{b} \\rvert} \\]\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The dot product of \\(\\vec{a}\\) with unit vector \\(\\vec{u}\\) ,\n        denoted \\(\\vec{a}\\)‚ãÖ\\(\\vec{u}\\) , is defined to be the projection\n        of \\(\\vec{a}\\) in the direction of \\(\\vec{u}\\) , or the amount\n        that \\(\\vec{a}\\) is pointing in the same direction as unit vector\n        \\(\\vec{u}\\) . Let\'s assume for a moment that \\(\\vec{a}\\) and\n        \\(\\vec{u}\\) are pointing in similar directions. Then, you can imagine\n        \\(\\vec{a}\\)‚ãÖ\\(\\vec{u}\\) as the length of the shadow of\n        \\(\\vec{a}\\) onto \\(\\vec{u}\\) if their tails were together and the\n        sun was shining from a direction perpendicular to \\(\\vec{u}\\) . By\n        forming a right triangle with \\(\\vec{a}\\) and this shadow, you can\n        use geometry to calculate that\n      </p>\n\n      <p class="text-center">\n        \\[ \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{u} = |\\vec{a}| \\cos \\theta \\]\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        where \\(\\theta\\) is the angle between \\(\\vec{a}\\) and\n        \\(\\vec{u}\\)\n      </p>\n\n      <img\n        src="https://mathinsight.org/media/image/image/dot_product_projection_unit_vector.png"\n        alt="angle-vector"\n        width="314"\n        height="262"\n        class="mx-auto"\n      />\n      <p>\n        If \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{u}\\) were perpendicular, there would be\n        no shadow. That corresponds to the case when \\( \\cos\\theta =\n        \\cos\\pi/2 = 0 \\) and \\(\\vec{a}‚ãÖ\\vec{u}=0\\) . If the angle\n        \\(\\theta\\) between \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{u}\\) were larger than\n        \\(\\pi/2\\) , then the shadow wouldn\'t hit \\(\\vec{u}\\) . Since in\n        this case \\(\\vec{u}\\theta<\\theta\\) , the dot product\n        \\(\\vec{a}‚ãÖ\\vec{u}\\) is also negative. You could think of\n        \\(-\\vec{a}‚ãÖ\\vec{u}\\) (which is positive in this case) as being the\n        length of the shadow of \\(\\vec{a}\\) on the vector \\(-\\vec{u}\\) ,\n        which points in the opposite direction of \\(\\vec{u}\\) .\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        But we need to get back to the dot product \\(\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}\\)\n        , where \\(\\vec{b}\\) may have a magnitude different than one. This dot\n        product \\(\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}\\) should depend on the magnitude of\n        both vectors, ‚à•\\(\\vec{a}\\)‚à• and ‚à•\\(\\vec{b}\\)‚à• , and be symmetric\n        in those vectors. Hence, we don\'t want to define\n        \\(\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}\\) to be exactly the projection of\n        \\(\\vec{a}\\) on \\(\\vec{b}\\) ; we want it to reduce to this\n        projection for the case when \\(\\vec{b}\\) is a unit vector. We can\n        accomplish this very easily: just plug the definition\n        \\(\\vec{u}=\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{‚à•b‚à•}\\) into our dot product definition\n        of equation (1) . This leads to the definition that the dot product\n        \\(\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}\\) , divided by the magnitude ‚à•\\(\\vec{b}\\)‚à•\n        of \\(\\vec{b}\\) , is the projection of \\(\\vec{a}\\) onto\n        \\(\\vec{b}\\) .\n      </p>\n      <p class="text-center">\n        \\[\\frac{\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}}{\\lvert \\vec{b} \\rvert} = \\lvert\n        \\vec{a} \\rvert \\cos\\theta \\]\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Then, if we multiply by through by ‚à•\\(\\vec{b}\\)‚à• , we get a nice\n        symmetric definition for the dot product \\(\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}\\) .\n      </p>\n      <p class="text-center">\n        \\[\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}=\\lvert \\vec{a} \\rvert \\lvert \\vec{b}\n        \\rvert \\cos \\theta \\]\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The picture of the geometric interpretation of\n        \\(\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}\\) is almost identical to the above picture\n        for \\(\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{u}\\) . We just have to remember that we have\n        to divide through by \\(\\lvert \\vec{b} \\rvert\\) to get the\n        projection of \\(\\vec{a}\\) onto \\(\\vec{b}\\) .\n      </p>\n      <img\n        src="https://mathinsight.org/media/image/image/dot_product_projection.png"\n        alt="dot_project"\n        width="409"\n        height="287"\n        class="mx-auto"\n      />\n      <section id="article-vector-application" class="space-y-4">\n      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Applications of Dot Product (Dot Vectors) in Computer Science and Physics</h2>\n      <div class="space-y-4">\n        <h1 class="font-semibold text-xl">Computer Science</h1>\n        <div class="pl-4">\n          <p class="font-medium">1.
